# RegularShowBook

Regular Show Book is a simple iOS application created to practice class and table view structure. This application lists some characters from the Regular Show cartoon and displays the details of the selected character.

## Application Overview

The application consists of two screens:

1. **Main Screen (`ViewController.swift`)**: This screen displays a list of characters from the Regular Show series. When the user taps on one of these characters, the app transitions to the second screen, which shows the details of the selected character.

2. **Detail Screen (`detailsVC.swift`)**: This screen displays the name, job, and image of the selected character.

## Installation

Clone the repository and open it in Xcode. Then, you can run the project on an iOS device or simulator.

## Technologies Used

The application is developed in the Swift programming language and uses UIKit to create the user interface.
